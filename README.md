# Knowledge-Based-System Material Selection (KBS MES)

This system is developed to demonstrate the work for " DEVELOPMENT OF A KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR MATERIAL SELECTION"

The process of KBS MES started once the user enter necessary information such as the project name, type of project, number of decision makers, type of evaluations and criteria considered for evaluation. If performance-based criteria are selected, the proposed ranking would suggest that VIKOR ranking would be optimal than TOPSIS. If the number of decision makers is only 1, objective weighting is used than subjective(fuzzy) weighting. The type of evaluation determined the nature of evaluation. If quantitative evaluation is selected, then the evaluation would use VIKOR and TOPSIS method. If qualitative or combination is selected, then the evaluation would use fuzzy VIKOR and TOPSIS. On the criteria toolbox, the criteria selection are limited to 20 by the system but can be extended if needed by the user.  Next, the user could also insert or remove new material data from the material database information management.   

Once the necessary information has been input by the user, the system would then be able to provide material evaluation and analysis report. This consist of ranking solution, rank correlations, the chart of membership function value of average DMs weighting for criteria, the chart of membership function value for criteria, average and average ranking and proposed solution.

To start, user must download and install appropriate modules. Then, the user can initiate main_file.py to execute the program.
